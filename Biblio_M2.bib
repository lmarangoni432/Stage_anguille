The upstream and downstream dynamics of catches, as well as some fish characteristics (length, weigth, pigmentary stage) were recorded. Glass-eels were caught mainly by night and in the downstream trap. These downstream catches mean that fish moved with the waterflow, which is in agreement with the hypothesis on selective tidal transport generallly admitted (swimming behaviour adapted to the migration in estuary, where upstream displacement occurs during the flood tide). Fish caught in the traps, (Movers) were slightly longer than fish collected in the substratum (Stayers). In one of the two replicates, movers were also more pigmented and heavier than stayers. Results suggest that swimming activity lasted for 3-4 hours.},

	abstract = {Estuaries, rias, fjords and lagoons (collectively called transitional waters, TW) are highly important ecosystems both for their high productivity but also as sites of urban and industrial development, supporting many major cities and ports. Increasingly they are accepted as transitional environments and in Europe this term has been given legal and management importance; indeed, in some cases this has led to decisions with high economic repercussions. We have thus revisited the fundamental properties and paradigms of these systems in the light of recent ecological theory. The analysis has produced a unifying approach to transitional waters, by adopting and expanding the concept of ecotone to whole ecosystems, rather than ecosystem boundaries. Furthermore we have addressed the paradoxes related to (1) the gradients concerning variability and stability in the system, (2) the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, as well as (3) the response and resilience of the system to anthropogenic stressors. We conclude that the term Transitional Waters is not merely a legal convenience or that the TW are merely an interface, with positive and negative characteristics, but ecological systems in their own right.},

Of that total, 89\% were infected with one or more metacercariae of the strigeid fluke, Uvulifer ambloplitis. Rhinichthys atratulus, Semotilus atromaculatus and Campostoma anomalum had the highest incidence of infection and the greatest number of individual parasites. Other pool-dwelling minnows such as Notropis cornutus and Pimephales notatus were also heavily infected, whereas Noiropis photogenus, which prefers deep, swift riffles, had very few cysts. The only non-minnows to approach the high totals of the pool-dwelling cyprinids were Catostomus commersoni and Etheostoma nigrum. Hypentelium nigricanz, which prefers faster water than Catostomus and three species of Etheostoma, which, unlike E. nigrum, are rime dwelling forms, also had lower incidences of infection and fewer cysts. Coitus bairdi, another rapid water species, did not develop black spot disease. Only 1 specimen of 225 Ericymba buccata, which occur over shifting, sandy bottoms, had a single cyst. Our data suggest that the species which inhabit the slower flowing waters of a stream are likely to be more heavily infected than their relatives which prefer faster water because snail hosts are absent and any cercariae present are more likely to be swept away in rapid water and thus have less of a chance to penetrate a host.},

	abstract = {Identifying factors and processes influencing natural mortality is fundamental to the understanding of population dynamics. Metabolic theory of ecology and experimental studies at the cross-species level suggest the existence of general patterns linking natural mortality to body mass and temperature. However, there is scant evidence that similar relationships also hold at the intra-specific scale, possibly because of the relatively narrow range of sizes and temperatures experienced by most species and the effect of local adaptation, which can obscure links between temperature and vital rates. In this sense, the European eel Anguilla anguilla, a panmictic species with a wide distribution range, provides a paradigmatic case. We compiled data published in the past 30 years on eel mortality during the continental phase of the life cycle for 15 eel stocks and calibrated a general model for mortality, considering the effects of body mass, temperature, stock density and gender. Estimated activation energy (E = 1.2 eV) was at the upper extreme reported for metabolic reactions. Estimated mortality rates (ranging between 0.02 year(-1) at 8°C, low density and 0.47 year(-1) at 18°C, high density for a body mass of 100 g) were appreciably lower than those of most fishes, most likely due to the exceptionally low energy-consuming metabolism of eel.},

The median estimated intake for recreational fishermen varied between 18.4 and 237.6 ng iPCBs kg−1 bw day−1, depending on the consumption scenario, while the estimated intake of the background population (consumers only) was 4.3 ng iPCBs kg−1 bw day−1. Since the levels of intake via eel for two intake scenarios were, respectively, 50 and 25 times higher than the intake of the background population, the body burden (BB) might be proportionally higher and reach levels of toxicological relevance. The intake of the seven iPCBs via consumption of self-caught eel in Flanders is at a level to cause serious concern.

	abstract = {Oceanic larvae of the European (Anguilla anguilla) and American (A. rostrata) eels have to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the Sargasso Sea to European or North American coasts before entering continental habitats. In some European rivers, eel recruitment is now {\textless}1\% of levels in the 1980s. A better understanding of the effects of anthropogenic pressures and environmental fluctuations on eel larvae and subsequent recruitment is a prerequisite to build efficient management plans. The present paper provides insight into the critical oceanic phase of the eel life cycle with a focus on the duration of the larval migration whose estimates varies between 7 months and more than 2 years in both species. Does this range correspond to a natural variability in larval duration or does it stem from methodological artefacts? We first review the different methods used to estimate the duration of larval migration and critically describe their possible sources of misinterpretation. We then evaluate the consistency of these methods with the current knowledge about the ecology and physiology of eel larvae and the physical oceanography. While a moderate discrepancy in migration duration was found between methods for the American eel, the discrepancy was large in the European eel. In this species, otolith microstructure studies indicated migration durations between 7 and 9 months, while other methods pointed to durations of about 2 years. We show that estimates in favour of a long migration duration seem more robust to methodological caveats than methods estimating short durations of migration.},

	abstract = {After their first transatlantic migration, larvae metamorphose into ‘glass eels’ and swim into estuarine areas of river deltas. The glass eels develop into the so-called elvers (˜65 mm) which swim up the rivers. They enter inland waters of northern Africa and Europe during different periods; Morocco: September—October; Spain, Portugal, South France: November—December; North France: January—March; British Islands and the Netherlands: February—April and Scandinavia: April-May. After reaching a length of 30 cm, elvers become known as yellow eels. These specimens have moved inland to coastal seawater or inland freshwater and continue to grow for some 8–15 years (males) up to 10–18 years (females), but they even may become much older.
After their period of growth, in preparation of their return trip to the spawning grounds, the eels transform into silver eel. Once the eel has undergone pre-puberty or “silvering”, which is accompanied by marked changes in morphology, body constitution and other features (see Chapter 2), it is ready to start its spawning migration. Its lifestyle changes radically. As we have seen in Chapter 2, silver eels stop feeding, they have already acquired salinity tolerance while still living in freshwater and finally they have begun their puberty. As European eels, Anguilla anguilla, spawn in the Sargasso sea, the silver eels must migrate from inland or coastal waters over a distance of about 6,000 km to reach this area. Somehow silver eels are triggered by environmental factors to start their migration.},

No difference in vertical distribution was ever found between Anguilla rostrata (American eel) and A. Anguilla (European eel). Anguilla leptocephali {\textless}5 mm long did not exhibit a diel vertical migration, as they were distributed between 50 m and 300 m both by day and by night. The vertical distribution of these small lepto-cephali is probably roughly representative of the depth distribution of adult spawning. Anguilla ≥5 mm did perform a diel vertical migration.Anguilla of the length range 5.0-19.9 mm mostly occurred between 100 m and 150 m by day and between 50 m and 100 m by night. Anguilla ≥20 mm were found deeper than Anguilla {\textless}20 mm by day, between 125 m and 275 m, and mostly between 30 m and 70 m by night. Nemichthys scolopaceus {\textless}80 mm did not perform a vertical migration, as they occurred between the surface and 100 m both by day and by night. Larger N. scolopaceus exhibited a diel vertical migration, as most were caught below 100 m by day and above 100 m by night. There was a distinct vertical migration in Derichthys serpenrinus. Larvae of this species mostly occurred between 125 m and 150 m by day and between 30 m and 70 m by night. The other common species of leptocephali (Serrivomer beani, S. breviden-tatus, Ariosoma balearicum, Conger oceanicus, Avocettina infans, Nessorhamphus ingolfianus, Anarchias yoshiae, Gymnothorax sp., andKaupichthys hyoproroides) were mostly found in the upper 100 m of the ocean at night. The ascent of leptocephali seemed to occur rapidly, mostly in the hour following sunset, and the descent to occur more gradually. However, interpretation of these data was difficult because of net avoidance. A high index of visual avoidance by day for most leptocephali, calculated from the ring net series, indicated that most leptocephali were efficient at seeing and escaping the net during daytime, but visual avoidance by day was not important in smallAnguilla.},

The relationship between tissue mirex concentration and body mass was used to separate eels into two groups: the proportion of eels migrating from contaminated areas (Lake Ontario and upper St. Lawrence River) increased as the migration season progressed. Vertebral malformations and basophilic foci in the liver (preneoplastic lesions) were more frequent at the end of the migratory season, when the eels were more heavily contaminated with organochlorine compounds. In contrast, mesenteric nematodes were more common in the first week of the season, when eels were less contaminated. Diameters and percentages of different stages of oocytes, and density and surface area of pigmented macrophage aggregates in the spleen, did not vary among weeks. While basophilic foci are specific biomarkers of exposure to environmental contaminants, vertebral malformations may be caused by a variety of other anthropogenic or natural factors.{\textbackslash}b Further studies are needed to confirm the observed associations between chemical contamination and pathological changes.},

This hypothesis was tested by screening glass eel from five locations (Ireland, Italy, Morocco, Sweden and U.K.), belonging to two cohorts at the cytochrome b (cyt b) locus (392 bp) of the mitochondrion and at five nuclear microsatellite loci. Seventeen cyt b haplotypes were detected, of which ten were singletons; the most common haplotype occurred in 47\% of all fish. Haplotype number increased significantly with latitude. Phylogeographical structure based on the cytoplasmic marker was weak (F
ST=0.014) and non-significant. Close similarity was revealed between British and Irish glass eel populations, and weak differentiation among the British/Irish, Atlantic Moroccan, Italian and Swedish Baltic populations, respectively. No hierarchical genetic structure was obvious. Levels of genetic variation detected with five microsatellites were much higher levels than found with allozymes in previous studies (mean number of alleles per locus=11.1; mean expected heterozygosity=0.68). Overall among-population microsatellite variance was low but significant (F
ST=0.004), and caused by the linked microsatellite loci Aan03 and Aan04. The Hardy–Weinberg–Castle equilibrium and the absence of gametic disequilibria at these loci in the Moroccan population might point to its genetic isolation, although the impact of just two out of five loci is puzzling. Given the weak differentiation typical for marine species and the limitations of our data, the results should be interpreted with caution. However, combined with recent evidence from a related study, the paradigm that the European eel constitutes a panmictic population becomes difficult to maintain.},

            Few fish stocks are as influenced by (intentional and inadvertent) human impacts as the European eel, all across the continent. The dynamics of this stock, however, are poorly understood—neither the causes of the historically low abundance, nor minimal protection levels, are beyond discussion. Rather than analysing contemporary processes, this article turns back in time—two centuries or more—unravelling historical abundances and distribution patterns; reviewing historical actions and objectives; and discussing technical developments and scientific advice—picturing the slippery slope the eel stock has come down from. The first claim, that the continental stock was in decline, dates from the early 1800s; stock-enhancement actions were initiated shortly after. Diffuse objectives, technical innovations, eternal optimism, and—above all—no quantification impede the exact evaluation of historical reports. After 1950, when quantification improved, a slow but consistent decline was observed, but it is only two decades after the crash in glass eel recruitment (in 1980), that protection plans addressed the bad status of the stock. A slippery slope, full of pitfalls—yet, we now observe several years of increasing recruitment.},

	abstract = {The decline of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) stock has led the European Commission to enforce a regulation (Council Regulation N° 1100/2007), in which each member state was required to establish an eel management plan. Various measures in the French plan aim at restoring river connectivity by mitigating the impact of obstacles on the colonization of continental water by eels. Consequently, many obstacles are going to be equipped with elver ladder in the near future. In this context, a method to assess the passability of an obstacle seems essential. In this study, we developed a tag–recapture method, appropriate to glass eels and elvers, and an associated multi-state mark–recapture model (i) to assess the passability of a ladder and (ii) to quantify the effect of various environmental factors on this passability. An application to a specific obstacle is applied as an illustrative example that demonstrates the relevance of the assessment method, and how the results can be used to propose technical solution to improve the efficiency of the ladder. Nine tag–recapture campaigns were carried on this obstacle, and about 4400 young eels were tagged. The model demonstrates that the efficiency of the ladder was rather low, especially during low river flow periods, mainly because of accessibility problems. The model also demonstrates the major influence of the river flow on the probability for an eel to pass the ladder; consequently, managing river flow during the migration period can be a relevant measure to improve river connectivity and facilitate colonization of the watershed.

	doi = {10.1098/rspb.2010.1547},
	abstract = {The European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) is distributed in coastal and inland habitats all over Europe, but spawns in the Sargasso Sea and is thus affected by both continental and oceanic factors. Since the 1980s a steady decline has been observed in the recruitment of glass eels to freshwater and in total eel landings. The eel is considered as critically endangered on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources Red List of species. The Skagerrak beach seine survey from Norway constitutes the longest fishery-independent dataset on yellow/silver eels (starting in 1904). The Skagerrak coastal region receives larvae born in the Sargasso Sea spawning areas that have followed the Gulf Stream/North Atlantic Drift before they penetrate far into the North Sea. The Skagerrak coastal time series is therefore particularly valuable for exploring the impacts of oceanic factors on fluctuations in eel recruitment abundance. Analyses showed that Sargasso Sea surface temperature was negatively correlated with eel abundance, with a lag of 12 years revealing a cyclic and detrimental effect of high temperatures on the newly hatched larvae. The North Atlantic Oscillation index and inflow of North Atlantic water into the North Sea were negatively correlated with eel abundance, with a lag of 11 years. Increased currents towards the North Atlantic during high North Atlantic Oscillation years may send larvae into the subpolar gyre before they are ready to metamorphose and settle, resulting in low recruitment in the northern part of the distribution area for these years. The Skagerrak time series was compared with glass eel recruitment to freshwater in the Netherlands (Den Oever glass eel time series), and similar patterns were found revealing a cycle linked to changes in oceanic factors affecting glass eel recruitment. The recent decline of eels in the Skagerrak also coincided with previously documented shifts in environmental conditions of the North Sea ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Eels colonize either marine, estuarine or freshwater habitats, with marine and estuarine eels tending to grow faster than freshwater eels. The reasons for these divergent migratory tactics and growth trajectories remain poorly -understood. In order to investigate the role of salinity preferences of glass eels in the control of habitat selection and growth plasticity, we sorted different contingents of glass eels Anguilla anguilla through 2 consecutive salinity preference tests. This allowed us to study the link between salinity preference and locomotor activity (i.e. positive rheotaxis), and to distinguish contingents of glass eels that were either plastic or fixed in their preference for freshwater (FW) or saltwater (SW). Subsequently, we monitored somatic growth of the different contingents in controlled SW and FW rearing conditions. Preference for FW was linked to high locomotor activity, a behavioral pattern likely to promote colonization of FW habitats in the wild. Accordingly, FWC (FW contingent, i.e. glass eels that preferred FW twice) exhibited poor growth, similar to those observed in wild FW eel populations. In contrast, preference for SW was linked to low locomotor activity, and the SWC (SW contingent, i.e. glass eels that preferred SW twice) had high growth rates in SW, as observed in wild marine and estuarine populations. The PCC (plastic contingent, i.e. glass eels that swappped their salinity preference) had an intermediary growth status that could be related to the 'nomad' life style of eels migrating between different habitat types during their life. Growth was significantly higher in SW compared to FW in all contingents, indicating that habitat salinity may directly affect growth, irrespective of food availability. Our results demonstrated that glass eel salinity preference was linked to their locomotor activity and growth performance, and provided a comprehensive ecological mechanism for the control of habitat distribution and growth patterns observed in wild eel populations.},

	abstract = {The fish predation rate by Grey Heron Ardea cinerea was studied during two breeding seasons (1987-
88) in the largest European colony at the Lake of Grand-Lieu (Loire-Atlantique, France). The herons'
diet was compared to the available fish population of its main feeding area, the marsh of Bourgneuf
(16000 ha) which is composed of former salt pans and meadows drained by a dense network of shallow
ditches. This study is the first attempt to assess the predation exerted by an ardeid colony on a fish
community over such an extensive natural environment. It also provides the first data about the abundance
and the structure of fish communities in shallow coastal dyked marshes. For this purpose, two
different sampling methods were used according to the water's salinity. In fresh waters, electrofishing
was used as the removal method, and density estimates were calculated with Carle \& Strub estimator
(1978). Fish were caught in randomly selected stations (sections of ditches enclosed by two 5 mm mesh
nets). In brackish waters, pools and ditches were drained. The distribution of the herons at the feeding
areas was determined by direct observations, by counting flights from the colony, and by radiotracking.
The diet was investigated by observing adult herons on the foraging areas, and by analyzing
the prey regurgitations of the young at the nests. The global food consumption was assessed from Marion
(1988), according to the birds' activity determined during 5 years of radio-tracking. Altogether, at least
39 species of fish were available in the herons' feeding area (during the reference period, 87-88) and the
mean fish biomass was 270 kg per ha of open water, or 30 kg per ha of marsh (open water = 11.2\% of
the marsh area). The fish community was dominated by eel Anguilla anguilla (145 kg ha- , 50,8\% of
the total biomass), and catfish Ictalurus melas (40 kg ha- 1, 14\%). Except for small and inaccessible
species (living in the deepest parts of the marsh), heron diet was very similar to fish species composition
of the community occurring in the marsh. The catfish was the species captured most frequently by
the heron (45 \% of the mass), the eel was second with 28 \% of the mass. The catfish was probably over
represented in the diet considering that they are caught in catfish-dumps created by professional fishermen at Grand-Lieu lake, in order to reduce the density of this undesirable species. Inversely, small species
such as Gasterosteus aculeatus were not found in the diet whereas they are very numerous in the marsh.
On average herons of Grand-Lieu colony catch 1.92 kg of fish per ha of marsh (6\% of the fish standing
crops in the marsh) during the breeding season, the main predation period.},

However, invasion mechanisms of river systems are poorly documented. This theory is based upon the identification of four distinct movement behaviors: „founders“ that colonize rivers until they settle in the first available suitable habitat they encounter; „pioneers“ that migrate upstream to the upper boundaries of the system; „home range dwellers“ that establish in a given area for several months to several years; and „nomads;“ which are erratic eels that perform a general upstream shift as they search for suitable areas to forage or to settle. These behaviors are not mutually exclusive, any eel shifting from one behavior to another, depending upon ontogenetic attributes (age, experience, morphology, physiological stage, etc.), population parameters that determine density-dependent movements; and environmental parameters such as food availability, temperature, flow, and the carrying capacity of the ecosystem.},

The estuarine hydrology leads to a natural trapping of migrants in a typical area where the current speed slows down. The location of this zone depends on hydraulic conditions. The greater the tide is the farther upstream this area will be. This phenomenon leads to an increasing catchability of elvers. (2) From April onwards, when the water temperature reaches 10–12 °C, the glass eels swim actively upstream in the estuary. Then, fish concentrate just below the first dam. This behaviour shift shows the beginning of the colonization process of the whole riverine system.},

South Platte River streamflow fluctuates over 2 orders of magnitude on several time scales-monthly, annually, and over multiple year wet-dry cycles. Relatively homogeneous sampling of a single host species with several parasite species provided a system that allowed assessment of the contribution of evolved parasite life cycles to population structure in an everchanging environment. No significant negative species-to-species associations were observed. Species abundance, order of abundance, and diversity were affected most strongly by streamflow, with high water reducing prevalence and abundance of larval trematode parasites. Each parasite species had its characteristic long- and short-term patterns of variation in population descriptor values, with mostly long-term stability superimposed on sometimes extreme short-term fluctuations of descriptor values. The differences in these characteristic patterns were considered products primarily of the evolved life cycle traits and transmission mechanisms operating in the common fluctuating environment. The parasite community as a whole showed resilience, returning to preperturbation diversity following extended periods of high water.},

	abstract = {L'objectif de ce travail de thèse est de tester si la dispersion des anguilles dans les bassins versants peut être considérée comme une stratégie conditionnelle où la nature et les signaux déclencheurs des mouvements changent durant l'ontogénie. Un programme de marquage-recapture est développé en amont de limite de marée dynamique afin de caractériser différentes stratégies de déplacement en conditions naturelles selon la taille des anguilles. Parallèlement, une étude en structure expérimentale est mise en place afin de caractériser les facteurs endogènes contrôlant les différentes tactiques de déplacement. Les anguillettes métamorphosées (anguilles de 60 `a 150 mm) adoptent un comportement majoritairement migrant tandis que les anguilles jaunes (individus de plus de 200 mm) adoptent un comportement majoritairement sédentaire. Chez les anguillettes, la migration amont est déclenchée par une forte activité de la glande thyroïde chez les individus en bonne condition corporelle. Chez les anguilles jaunes, les individus en déplacement sont minoritaires et présentent des signes de stress physiologique, suggérant que les mouvements des anguilles jaunes répondent principalement à des interactions agonistes. Ainsi, la diversité de patterns de dispersion des anguilles dans les habitats continentaux pourrait être contrôlée par une transition ontogénique. Celle-ci a lieu entre le stade anguillette qui migre vers l'amont lorsque son statut énergétique le permet et le stade anguille jaune sédentaire qui se déplace à la recherche de nourriture et d'habitat. En nous basant sur un modèle conceptuel de stratégie évolutionnairement stable (ESS), nous suggérons que les changements de densité de population sont cruciaux dans l'expression et l'évolution de ces comportements.},

the width of ditch section, the silt depth, and the density of emergent plants. Such ecological profiles were significantly
different between small ({\textless}240 mm) and large eels ({\textgreater}360 mm): small eels were more widespread than large eels. Large eels were
absent or at low densities in shallow ditches with a high aquatic plant cover obstructing the water column and a large quantity
of silt. These characteristics seem to define the ditches not directly connected with the main river where dredging operations
were rare. Management of regular dredging operations in the channels by maintaining a mosaic of permanent aquatic habitats
and avoiding the heavy silt loads in most ditches should be promoted. This dredging operation was probably one of the most
promising ways for restoring inland eel stocks.},

	abstract = {Understanding the effects of pollutants on the genome is of crucial importance to preserve the evolutionary potential of endangered natural populations. The highly vagile European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) has suffered a dramatic decline in recruitment since two decades, urging for a better understanding of the genetic impact of pollution. Its catadromous life history constitutes a model to assess local selection of pollutants on condition and genetic variability, as juveniles recruit in European rivers without appreciable pollution load or interfering genetic background. Because of its high fat content and local benthic feeding behaviour, the feeding stage is considered extremely prone to the bioaccumulation of pollutants. We studied the relationship between heavy metal bioaccumulation, fitness (condition) and genetic variability in the European eel. The muscle tissues of 78 sub-adult eels, originating from three Belgian river basins (Scheldt, Meuse and Yser), were examined for nine heavy metal pollutants (Hg, Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr, As and Se), while in total 123 individuals were genotyped at 12 allozyme and 8 microsatellite loci. A significant negative correlation between heavy metal pollution load and condition was observed, suggesting an impact of pollution on the health of sub-adult eels. In general, we observed a reduced genetic variability in strongly polluted eels, as well as a negative correlation between level of bioaccumulation and allozymatic multi-locus heterozygosity (MLH). Microsatellite genetic variability did not show any pollution related differences, suggesting a differential response at metabolic enzymes and possibly direct overdominance of heterozygous individuals.},

	abstract = {Magnetosensitivity of the Japanese eel, Anguilla japonica, was examined by conditioning and electrocardiography. Marine eels, river eels and farmed eels were conditioned to an imposed magnetic field ranging from 12,663 nT to 192,473 nT parallel to the fish body, which was placed along the earth's west-east axis. Electrocardiograms were recorded with electrodes placed close to the fish body inside a PVC pipe shelter. After 10-40 conditioning runs, all the eels exhibited a significant conditioned response (i.e. slowing of the heart beat) to a 192,473 nT magnetic field and even to a 12,663 nT magnetic field, respectively equivalent to 5.92x and 0.38x the horizontal geomagnetic field (32,524 nT) at our laboratory. The west-east vector of the imposed magnetic field (12,663 nT) combined with that of the geomagnetic field and produced a horizontal resultant magnetic field of 21 degrees easterly. Therefore, Japanese eel are magnetosensitive whether they are at sea, in the river or in the farm. Results of the present study were compared with those of past studies that showed no magnetic sense in the American eel, Anguilla rostrata, and the European eel, Anguilla anguilla.},

Female eels were significantly larger and older than males. Female eels also had a significantly higher mean growth rate. The addition of life history data from Annaquatucket River eels to published silver eel data from locations throughout the eels' range shows that female size at migration is positively correlated with latitude (r = 0.56, p = 0.05) but male size is not (r = 0.54, p = 0.17). Female age was not related to latitude (r = 0.57, p = 0.27) but male age showed a positive relationship (r = 0.87, p = 0.05). Growth rates for females and males were inversely related to latitude (r = -0.98, p = 0.02 and r = -0.95, p = 0.05, respectively). Differences between the latitudinal relationships and life history traits of the sexes may be due to differences in life history strategies.},

As found previously in the River Elbe, eels with male gonads predominated (n=55); 25 were undifferentiated. Of the gonadal males 26 were karyological males and 16 karyological females; the rest could not be identified by chromosome patterns. In contrast, all but one of the Elbe eels with female gonads (n=28) had female sex chromosomes. Some aspects of the sex reversal documented in the eel are considered.},

Reflecting layers made up of the purines, guanine and hypoxanthine were associated with chromatophore layers. Purine concentrations (as a percentage of total skin dry weight) decreased with maturity but a reorganization of the reflecting elements occurred. Colour changes associated with maturation were due to the redistribution of purines. Spectral and angular reflectance measurements indicate that the integument has camouflage value and colour changes can be related to the change in habitat occurring with migration. The usefulness of colour as an index of sexual maturity is discussed.},

The European eel Anguilla anguilla (Linnaeus, 1758) stock is declining rapidly due to overfishing, pollution, habitat degradation, diseases, and oceanic conditions. We analyzed arrival waves of glass eels collected in the Bay of Biscay and the western Mediterranean area during the period 2001-2003. We observed significant differences in length, weight, and condition between Atlantic and Mediterranean samples, and among arrival waves within sites. All samples were screened for genetic variation using ten allozyme and six microsatellite loci. We observed a pattern of genetic patchiness among arrival waves, namely a highly significant genetic differentiation without a temporal grouping of samples. Although natural selection and gene flow could also play a role, we suggest that the pattern observed results from the high variance in reproductive success in each spawning season. A low effective population size might have contributed to the current decline in the abundance of European eel. A precautionary approach to fisheries should be implemented in order to preserve maximal genetic potential to cope with changing anthropogenic and environment pressures.},

Because silver eels fast when they leave the freshwater system, the transoceanic migration forces them to constitute energy reserves in the form of muscle lipids, that are needed for successful spawning. Using species biological data, toxicological and ecotoxicological information, hypotheses are given to assess the contribution of pollution from freshwater sources to the recorded decline in the American and European eels fisheries since the 1980s. This paper first describes the lipid storage problems and the relative migratory capacities. Then several studies on the accumulation of xenobiotics in various anatomical compartments, on the biological half-lives of these compounds, and on their sublethal toxicity, are reviewed. During migration, lipid mobilization returns persistent lipophilic pollutants back into circulation, these being concentrated particularly in gonads at the crucial time of gametogenesis. Extrapolation of toxicological analysis (individual physiology) to the population level (spawning success) suggests that the quality of future spawners leaving freshwaters is one of the prime factors for the conservation of this threatened species.},

It is only during the last three decades, however, that any real results have been attained. It has long been known that the full-grown eels move down in the autumn from their rivers and lakes to the sea; the most important eel fisheries, indeed, are based upon this seaward migration. The eels do not return again from the sea, but in early spring there appear on the coasts myriads of small young eels, eagerly seeking their way up to fresh-water. These eel fry are known in most countries of Europe, and occur in some parts in such quantities as to form the object of a particular industry; for instance, in the River Severn in England, where they are known as “elvers.” Until 1896, the elver stage was the earliest stage of development in which the eel was known on the shores of Europe, and it was generally supposed that the elvers arriving in the spring were the offspring of the eels which had migrated during the previous autumn. They are not, however, altogether minute, like the newly-hatched larva of a cod or herring; on the contrary, they are no less than 6-7 cm. in length.},

Nutrient budgets underline: i) a clear partition of diffuse and point sources with respect to the specific activities of the watersheds, ii) the importance of riparian retention, responsible for 25–50\% of nitrogen retention, iii) the role played by benthic processes, resulting in the retention of up to 45\% of the phosphorus and 35\% of the silica entering the river systems.

These behaviors are not mutually exclusive, any eel shifting from one behavior to another, depending upon ontogenetic attributes (age, experience, morphology, physiological stage, etc.), population parameters that determine density-dependent movements; and environmental parameters such as food availability, temperature, flow, and the carrying capacity of the ecosystem.},

	abstract = {The migration pattern of silver eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) in the Baltic is well documented from many tagging experiments. This particular investigation differed from previous taggings in that the background of all the eels used was the same. They came from a 1980 stocking programme and had been imported from France as glass eels. When migrating these stocked eels missed the outlet of the Baltic and continued in a south-westerly direction. They were still reported in this southern-most area more than 4 yr later. Indigenous eels turn northwards after passing the south of Sweden and leave the Baltic through the narrow Sound. Since the formerly stocked eels had never been in the Baltic, the absence of an imprinted olfaction cue may explain their orientation failure. Although lacking an imprinted olfaction cue eels were recaptured mainly in a very restricted area in the southwestern Baltic. This reflects another cue, genetic or imprinted during the Atlantic journey. This second cue, temperate, can also serve as the trigger which causes eels to stop migrating and to initiate spawning. The enclosed Baltic acts as a giant trap for eels from the huge stocking programmes undertaken there. As a consequence stocked eels probably contribute little to spawning stocks in the Sargasso Sea which may have contributed to the decrease in abundance of glass eels reported from western Europe in recent decades.},

	abstract = {Studies were conducted during 1991-1993 on environmental factors affecting the upstream migration of eels in the Rivers Severn and Avon, England. Migrants ({\textgreater} 156 000 pigmented elvers and {\textgreater} 189 000 juveniles) were trapped as they attempted to ascend weir or sluice barriers. Multiple regression models were developed to compare catches per trap per night (C) with data for various key environmental parameters at seven sites, from the tidal limit to a maximum of 42.5 km upstream. The key stimulus for migration of both elvers and juveniles at the tidal limit was water temperature, with some weaker monthly influences related to seasonal temperature increases. Smaller annual influences probably related to earlier glass eel recruitment into the lower estuary. A weak early tidal effect was demonstrated only once, in 1993 in the Severn. Temperature also exerted significant effects on C of juvenile eels at the tidal limit and in the non-tidal rivers, although effects weakened with distance upstream. Year, month, river flows and whether traps were mounted on weirs or sluices made only small contributions at a few sites. Distance between traps also contributed to combined data for upper Severn sites. The threshold temperature in all cases was 14-16°C, with low to zero catches below 10-11°C, catch maxima being achieved above 18-20°C. The implications of strong temperature-dependence of migration in relation to stock recruitment and management are discussed. Special reference is made to recent decreases in recruitment of eels to Europe and N. America and possible long-term effects of global warming.},

	abstract = {European eels (Anguilla anguilla) undertake spawning migrations of more than 5000 km from continental Europe and North Africa to frontal zones in the Sargasso Sea. Subsequently, the larval offspring are advected by large-scale eastward ocean currents towards continental waters. However, the Sargasso Sea is oligotrophic, with generally low plankton biomass, and the feeding biology of eel larvae has so far remained a mystery, hampering understanding of this peculiar life history. DNA barcoding of gut contents of 61 genetically identified A. anguilla larvae caught in the Sargasso Sea showed that even the smallest larvae feed on a striking variety of plankton organisms, and that gelatinous zooplankton is of fundamental dietary importance. Hence, the specific plankton composition seems essential for eel larval feeding and growth, suggesting a linkage between eel survival and regional plankton productivity. These novel insights into the prey of Atlantic eels may furthermore facilitate eel larval rearing in aquaculture, which ultimately may replace the unsustainable use of wild-caught glass eels.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ecss.2009.11.019},
	abstract = {The concept of trophic level is particularly relevant in order to improve knowledge of the structure and the functioning of an ecosystem. A precise estimation of fish trophic levels based on nitrogen isotopic signatures in environments as complex and fluctuant as estuaries requires a good description of the pelagic and benthic trophic chains and a knowledge of organic matter sources at the bottom. In this study these points are considered in the case of the Gironde estuary (south west France, Europe). To obtain a good picture of the food web, fish stomach content analyses and a bibliographic synthesis of the prey feeding ecology were carried out. Fish trophic levels were calculated from these results and δ15N data. The feeding link investigation enabled us to identify qualitatively and quantitatively the different preys consumed by each fish group studied, to distinguish the prey feeding on benthos from those feeding on pelagos and to characterize the different nutritive pools at the base of the system. Among the species studied, only Liza ramada and the flatfish (Platichthys flesus and Solea solea) depend mainly on benthic trophic compartments. All the other fish groups depend on several trophic (benthic and/or pelagic) sources. These results enabled us to correct the calculation of fish trophic levels which are coherent with their feeding ecology data obtained from the nitrogen isotopic integrative period. The present work shows that trophic positions are linked with the feeding ecology of fish species and vary according to individual size. Ecological data also allow the correction of the isotopic data by eliminating absurd results and showing the complementarity of the two methods. This work is the first to consider source variability in the fish food web. This is an indispensable step for trophic studies in a dynamic environment. The investigation of matter fluxes and recycling processes at the food web base would provide a useful improvement in future estuarine food web research.},

Our results demonstrate the high predictive power of the ANN models. Some macro‐ and microscale factors, such as distance from the sea, depth and flow velocity, have the most significant influence on the models. Influence of distance from the sea appears to be very different from the spatial organisation usually described in river systems. In fact, the general tendencies of total eel densities according to the distance from the sea showed that densities increase weakly upstream. Another outcome was the variations in habitat preference according to the eel size, even if this species is spread over practically every type of microhabitat. Small eels were mainly found in shallow habitats with strong abundance of aquatic vegetation, whereas large eels tend to be found in intermediate to high depth with small to intermediate abundance of aquatic vegetation. Finally, we hypothesise that European eels change behaviour and microhabitat characteristic preference around a size of 300mm.},

Egg hatching rate, second-stage larval survival and larval infectivity were maximal in fresh water and declined with increase in salinity. Larvae survived up to 100 d in fresh water, 70 d in 50 \% sea water and 40 d in 100\% sea water. Infectivity experiments demonstrated that salinity influenced transmission success throughout the life cycle by decreasing total infectivity of the larval population in utero within female A. crassus and when larvae were free-living in the aquatic environment. Infectivity was age-dependent in relation to salinity. Larvae were infective to intermediate and paratenic hosts for up to 80 d in fresh water, 21 d in 50\% sea water and up to 8 d in 100\% sea water. The data confirm field observations that infection levels decrease with an increase in salinity. The study contributes to experimental verification of the colonization abilities of A. crassus and supports the hypothesis that A. crassus can be disseminated and transmitted in brackish water.

	abstract = {The three northern hemisphere anguillid eel species experienced recruitment declines at similar times beginning in the 1970s and 1980s, but the exact causes of the declines have remained unclear. Attention focused on two categories of possible causes that included (i) anthropogenic impacts on eel growth habitats, such as dam construction, degradation and pollution of habitats, introduction of parasites, overﬁshing and (ii) changes in ocean-atmospheric conditions affecting their marine life-history stages. The cumulative effects of reaching peaks in dam construction, levels of pollution, and eutrophication just before the eel declines likely had reduced eel production in many areas, and contamination by metallic and organic compounds and parasites may have reduced reproductive success. Shifts in ocean-atmospheric conditions also occurred just before the eel declines that could have reduced feeding success of larvae or disrupted larval transport. If oceanic regime shifts reduced production of the marine snow food of eel larvae, it may have affected larval survival and recruitment success, especially if there is a critical time-window for successful larval ﬁrst feeding when marine snow particles need to be abundant. A reduction of these particles could result in density-dependent early mortality of the larvae of each spawning event, and competition for marine snow particles with sympatrically spawning mesopelagic eel larvae would amplify this effect. Nutrient reductions causing shifts in the relative abundance of phytoplankton contributing to marine snow production and of ubiquitous cyanobacteria may mediate levels of larval survival in areas with high spawning activity. Reductions of eels reaching the spawning area from species range margins that spawn outside of peak spawning periods could have reduced recruitment further. It appears likely that a variety of impacts, oceanic and anthropogenic occurred simultaneously causing sudden declines of these eel populations.},
