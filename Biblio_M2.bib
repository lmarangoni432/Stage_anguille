The upstream and downstream dynamics of catches, as well as some fish characteristics (length, weigth, pigmentary stage) were recorded. Gla\ss-eels were caught mainly by night and in the downstream trap. These downstream catches mean that fish moved with the waterflow, which is in agreement with the hypothesis on selective tidal transport generallly admitted (swimming behaviour adapted to the migration in estuary, where upstream displacement occurs during the flood tide). Fish caught in the traps, (Movers) were slightly longer than fish collected in the substratum (Stayers). In one of the two replicates, movers were also more pigmented and heavier than stayers. Results suggest that swimming activity lasted for 3-4 hours.},

	abstract = {Estuaries, rias, fjords and lagoons (collectively called transitional waters, TW) are highly important ecosystems both for their high productivity but also as sites of urban and industrial development, supporting many major cities and ports. Increasingly they are accepted as transitional environments and in Europe this term has been given legal and management importance; indeed, in some cases this has led to decisions with high economic repercu\ssions. We have thus revisited the fundamental properties and paradigms of these systems in the light of recent ecological theory. The analysis has produced a unifying approach to transitional waters, by adopting and expanding the concept of ecotone to whole ecosystems, rather than ecosystem boundaries. Furthermore we have addre\ssed the paradoxes related to (1) the gradients concerning variability and stability in the system, (2) the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, as well as (3) the response and resilience of the system to anthropogenic stre\ssors. We conclude that the term Transitional Waters is not merely a legal convenience or that the TW are merely an interface, with positive and negative characteristics, but ecological systems in their own right.},

Of that total, 89\% were infected with one or more metacercariae of the strigeid fluke, Uvulifer ambloplitis. Rhinichthys atratulus, Semotilus atromaculatus and Campostoma anomalum had the highest incidence of infection and the greatest number of individual parasites. Other pool-dwelling minnows such as Notropis cornutus and Pimephales notatus were also heavily infected, whereas Noiropis photogenus, which prefers deep, swift riffles, had very few cysts. The only non-minnows to approach the high totals of the pool-dwelling cyprinids were Catostomus commersoni and Etheostoma nigrum. Hypentelium nigricanz, which prefers faster water than Catostomus and three species of Etheostoma, which, unlike E. nigrum, are rime dwelling forms, also had lower incidences of infection and fewer cysts. Coitus bairdi, another rapid water species, did not develop black spot disease. Only 1 specimen of 225 Ericymba buccata, which occur over shifting, sandy bottoms, had a single cyst. Our data suggest that the species which inhabit the slower flowing waters of a stream are likely to be more heavily infected than their relatives which prefer faster water because snail hosts are absent and any cercariae present are more likely to be swept away in rapid water and thus have le\ss of a chance to penetrate a host.},

Metabolic theory of ecology and experimental studies at the cro\ss-species level suggest the existence of general patterns linking natural mortality to body ma\ss and temperature. However, there is scant evidence that similar relationships also hold at the intra-specific scale, po\ssibly because of the relatively narrow range of sizes and temperatures experienced by most species and the effect of local adaptation, which can obscure links between temperature and vital rates. In this sense, the European eel Anguilla anguilla, a panmictic species with a wide distribution range, provides a paradigmatic case. We compiled data published in the past 30 years on eel mortality during the continental phase of the life cycle for 15 eel stocks and calibrated a general model for mortality, considering the effects of body ma\ss, temperature, stock density and gender. Estimated activation energy (E = 1.2 eV) was at the upper extreme reported for metabolic reactions. Estimated mortality rates (ranging between 0.02 year(-1) at 8\textdegreeC, low density and 0.47 year(-1) at 18\textdegreeC, high density for a body ma\ss of 100 g) were appreciably lower than those of most fishes, most likely due to the exceptionally low energy-consuming metabolism of eel.},

Since the levels of intake via eel for two intake scenarios were, respectively, 50 and 25 times higher than the intake of the background population, the body burden (BB) might be proportionally higher and reach levels of toxicological relevance. The intake of the seven iPCBs via consumption of self-caught eel in Flanders is at a level to cause serious concern.

	abstract = {Oceanic larvae of the European (Anguilla anguilla) and American (A. rostrata) eels have to cro\ss the Atlantic Ocean from the Sarga\sso Sea to European or North American coasts before entering continental habitats. In some European rivers, eel recruitment is now {\textle\ss}1\% of levels in the 1980s. A better understanding of the effects of anthropogenic pre\ssures and environmental fluctuations on eel larvae and subsequent recruitment is a prerequisite to build efficient management plans. The present paper provides insight into the critical oceanic phase of the eel life cycle with a focus on the duration of the larval migration whose estimates varies between 7 months and more than 2 years in both species. Does this range correspond to a natural variability in larval duration or does it stem from methodological artefacts? We first review the different methods used to estimate the duration of larval migration and critically describe their po\ssible sources of misinterpretation. We then evaluate the consistency of these methods with the current knowledge about the ecology and physiology of eel larvae and the physical oceanography. While a moderate discrepancy in migration duration was found between methods for the American eel, the discrepancy was large in the European eel. In this species, otolith microstructure studies indicated migration durations between 7 and 9 months, while other methods pointed to durations of about 2 years. We show that estimates in favour of a long migration duration seem more robust to methodological caveats than methods estimating short durations of migration.},

	abstract = {After their first transatlantic migration, larvae metamorphose into ‘gla\ss eels’ and swim into estuarine areas of river deltas. The gla\ss eels develop into the so-called elvers (˜65 mm) which swim up the rivers. They enter inland waters of northern Africa and Europe during different periods; Morocco: September--- (em dash)October; Spain, Portugal, South France: November--- (em dash)December; North France: January--- (em dash)March; British Islands and the Netherlands: February--- (em dash)April and Scandinavia: April-May. After reaching a length of 30 cm, elvers become known as yellow eels. These specimens have moved inland to coastal seawater or inland freshwater and continue to grow for some 8-- (dash)15 years (males) up to 10-- (dash)18 years (females), but they even may become much older.
After their period of growth, in preparation of their return trip to the spawning grounds, the eels transform into silver eel. Once the eel has undergone pre-puberty or “silvering”, which is accompanied by marked changes in morphology, body constitution and other features (see Chapter 2), it is ready to start its spawning migration. Its lifestyle changes radically. As we have seen in Chapter 2, silver eels stop feeding, they have already acquired salinity tolerance while still living in freshwater and finally they have begun their puberty. As European eels, Anguilla anguilla, spawn in the Sarga\sso sea, the silver eels must migrate from inland or coastal waters over a distance of about 6,000 km to reach this area. Somehow silver eels are triggered by environmental factors to start their migration.},

No difference in vertical distribution was ever found between Anguilla rostrata (American eel) and A. Anguilla (European eel). Anguilla leptocephali {\textle\ss}5 mm long did not exhibit a diel vertical migration, as they were distributed between 50 m and 300 m both by day and by night. The vertical distribution of these small lepto-cephali is probably roughly representative of the depth distribution of adult spawning. Anguilla ≥5 mm did perform a diel vertical migration.Anguilla of the length range 5.0-19.9 mm mostly occurred between 100 m and 150 m by day and between 50 m and 100 m by night. Anguilla ≥20 mm were found deeper than Anguilla {\textle\ss}20 mm by day, between 125 m and 275 m, and mostly between 30 m and 70 m by night. Nemichthys scolopaceus {\textle\ss}80 mm did not perform a vertical migration, as they occurred between the surface and 100 m both by day and by night. Larger N. scolopaceus exhibited a diel vertical migration, as most were caught below 100 m by day and above 100 m by night. There was a distinct vertical migration in Derichthys serpenrinus. Larvae of this species mostly occurred between 125 m and 150 m by day and between 30 m and 70 m by night. The other common species of leptocephali (Serrivomer beani, S. breviden-tatus, Ariosoma balearicum, Conger oceanicus, Avocettina infans, Ne\ssorhamphus ingolfianus, Anarchias yoshiae, Gymnothorax sp., andKaupichthys hyoproroides) were mostly found in the upper 100 m of the ocean at night. The ascent of leptocephali seemed to occur rapidly, mostly in the hour following sunset, and the descent to occur more gradually. However, interpretation of these data was difficult because of net avoidance. A high index of visual avoidance by day for most leptocephali, calculated from the ring net series, indicated that most leptocephali were efficient at seeing and escaping the net during daytime, but visual avoidance by day was not important in smallAnguilla.},

Vertebral malformations and basophilic foci in the liver (preneoplastic lesions) were more frequent at the end of the migratory season, when the eels were more heavily contaminated with organochlorine compounds. In contrast, mesenteric nematodes were more common in the first week of the season, when eels were le\ss contaminated. Diameters and percentages of different stages of oocytes, and density and surface area of pigmented macrophage aggregates in the spleen, did not vary among weeks. While basophilic foci are specific biomarkers of exposure to environmental contaminants, vertebral malformations may be caused by a variety of other anthropogenic or natural factors.{\textbackslash}b Further studies are needed to confirm the observed a\ssociations between chemical contamination and pathological changes.},

	abstract = {The spawning population of European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) has been considered panmictic on the basis of genetic markers and morphometric studies. This hypothesis was tested by screening gla\ss eel from five locations (Ireland, Italy, Morocco, Sweden and U.K.), belonging to two cohorts at the cytochrome b (cyt b) locus (392 bp) of the mitochondrion and at five nuclear microsatellite loci. Seventeen cyt b haplotypes were detected, of which ten were singletons; the most common haplotype occurred in 47\% of all fish. Haplotype number increased significantly with latitude. Phylogeographical structure based on the cytoplasmic marker was weak (F
ST=0.014) and non-significant. Close similarity was revealed between British and Irish gla\ss eel populations, and weak differentiation among the British/Irish, Atlantic Moroccan, Italian and Swedish Baltic populations, respectively. No hierarchical genetic structure was obvious. Levels of genetic variation detected with five microsatellites were much higher levels than found with allozymes in previous studies (mean number of alleles per locus=11.1; mean expected heterozygosity=0.68). Overall among-population microsatellite variance was low but significant (F
ST=0.004), and caused by the linked microsatellite loci Aan03 and Aan04. The Hardy-- (dash)Weinberg-- (dash)Castle equilibrium and the absence of gametic disequilibria at these loci in the Moroccan population might point to its genetic isolation, although the impact of just two out of five loci is puzzling. Given the weak differentiation typical for marine species and the limitations of our data, the results should be interpreted with caution. However, combined with recent evidence from a related study, the paradigm that the European eel constitutes a panmictic population becomes difficult to maintain.},

	abstract = {The decline of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) stock has led the European Commi\ssion to enforce a regulation (Council Regulation N\textdegree 1100/2007), in which each member state was required to establish an eel management plan. Various measures in the French plan aim at restoring river connectivity by mitigating the impact of obstacles on the colonization of continental water by eels. Consequently, many obstacles are going to be equipped with elver ladder in the near future. In this context, a method to a\sse\ss the pa\ssability of an obstacle seems e\ssential. In this study, we developed a tag-- (dash)recapture method, appropriate to gla\ss eels and elvers, and an a\ssociated multi-state mark-- (dash)recapture model (i) to a\sse\ss the pa\ssability of a ladder and (ii) to quantify the effect of various environmental factors on this pa\ssability. An application to a specific obstacle is applied as an illustrative example that demonstrates the relevance of the a\sse\ssment method, and how the results can be used to propose technical solution to improve the efficiency of the ladder. Nine tag-- (dash)recapture campaigns were carried on this obstacle, and about 4400 young eels were tagged. The model demonstrates that the efficiency of the ladder was rather low, especially during low river flow periods, mainly because of acce\ssibility problems. The model also demonstrates the major influence of the river flow on the probability for an eel to pa\ss the ladder; consequently, managing river flow during the migration period can be a relevant measure to improve river connectivity and facilitate colonization of the watershed.

	abstract = {The European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) is distributed in coastal and inland habitats all over Europe, but spawns in the Sarga\sso Sea and is thus affected by both continental and oceanic factors. Since the 1980s a steady decline has been observed in the recruitment of gla\ss eels to freshwater and in total eel landings. The eel is considered as critically endangered on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources Red List of species. The Skagerrak beach seine survey from Norway constitutes the longest fishery-independent dataset on yellow/silver eels (starting in 1904). The Skagerrak coastal region receives larvae born in the Sarga\sso Sea spawning areas that have followed the Gulf Stream/North Atlantic Drift before they penetrate far into the North Sea. The Skagerrak coastal time series is therefore particularly valuable for exploring the impacts of oceanic factors on fluctuations in eel recruitment abundance. Analyses showed that Sarga\sso Sea surface temperature was negatively correlated with eel abundance, with a lag of 12 years revealing a cyclic and detrimental effect of high temperatures on the newly hatched larvae. The North Atlantic Oscillation index and inflow of North Atlantic water into the North Sea were negatively correlated with eel abundance, with a lag of 11 years. Increased currents towards the North Atlantic during high North Atlantic Oscillation years may send larvae into the subpolar gyre before they are ready to metamorphose and settle, resulting in low recruitment in the northern part of the distribution area for these years. The Skagerrak time series was compared with gla\ss eel recruitment to freshwater in the Netherlands (Den Oever gla\ss eel time series), and similar patterns were found revealing a cycle linked to changes in oceanic factors affecting gla\ss eel recruitment. The recent decline of eels in the Skagerrak also coincided with previously documented shifts in environmental conditions of the North Sea ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Eels colonize either marine, estuarine or freshwater habitats, with marine and estuarine eels tending to grow faster than freshwater eels. The reasons for these divergent migratory tactics and growth trajectories remain poorly -understood. In order to investigate the role of salinity preferences of gla\ss eels in the control of habitat selection and growth plasticity, we sorted different contingents of gla\ss eels Anguilla anguilla through 2 consecutive salinity preference tests. This allowed us to study the link between salinity preference and locomotor activity (i.e. positive rheotaxis), and to distinguish contingents of gla\ss eels that were either plastic or fixed in their preference for freshwater (FW) or saltwater (SW). Subsequently, we monitored somatic growth of the different contingents in controlled SW and FW rearing conditions. Preference for FW was linked to high locomotor activity, a behavioral pattern likely to promote colonization of FW habitats in the wild. Accordingly, FWC (FW contingent, i.e. gla\ss eels that preferred FW twice) exhibited poor growth, similar to those observed in wild FW eel populations. In contrast, preference for SW was linked to low locomotor activity, and the SWC (SW contingent, i.e. gla\ss eels that preferred SW twice) had high growth rates in SW, as observed in wild marine and estuarine populations. The PCC (plastic contingent, i.e. gla\ss eels that swappped their salinity preference) had an intermediary growth status that could be related to the 'nomad' life style of eels migrating between different habitat types during their life. Growth was significantly higher in SW compared to FW in all contingents, indicating that habitat salinity may directly affect growth, irrespective of food availability. Our results demonstrated that gla\ss eel salinity preference was linked to their locomotor activity and growth performance, and provided a comprehensive ecological mechanism for the control of habitat distribution and growth patterns observed in wild eel populations.},

	shorttitle = {A\sse\ssment of {Grey} heron predation on fish communities},
	abstract = {The fish predation rate by Grey Heron Ardea cinerea was studied during two breeding seasons (1987-
88) in the largest European colony at the Lake of Grand-Lieu (Loire-Atlantique, France). The herons'
diet was compared to the available fish population of its main feeding area, the marsh of Bourgneuf
(16000 ha) which is composed of former salt pans and meadows drained by a dense network of shallow
ditches. This study is the first attempt to a\sse\ss the predation exerted by an ardeid colony on a fish
community over such an extensive natural environment. It also provides the first data about the abundance
and the structure of fish communities in shallow coastal dyked marshes. For this purpose, two
different sampling methods were used according to the water's salinity. In fresh waters, electrofishing
was used as the removal method, and density estimates were calculated with Carle \& Strub estimator
(1978). Fish were caught in randomly selected stations (sections of ditches enclosed by two 5 mm mesh
nets). In brackish waters, pools and ditches were drained. The distribution of the herons at the feeding
areas was determined by direct observations, by counting flights from the colony, and by radiotracking.
The diet was investigated by observing adult herons on the foraging areas, and by analyzing
the prey regurgitations of the young at the nests. The global food consumption was a\sse\ssed from Marion
(1988), according to the birds' activity determined during 5 years of radio-tracking. Altogether, at least
39 species of fish were available in the herons' feeding area (during the reference period, 87-88) and the
mean fish bioma\ss was 270 kg per ha of open water, or 30 kg per ha of marsh (open water = 11.2\% of
the marsh area). The fish community was dominated by eel Anguilla anguilla (145 kg ha- , 50,8\% of
the total bioma\ss), and catfish Ictalurus melas (40 kg ha- 1, 14\%). Except for small and inacce\ssible
species (living in the deepest parts of the marsh), heron diet was very similar to fish species composition
of the community occurring in the marsh. The catfish was the species captured most frequently by
the heron (45 \% of the ma\ss), the eel was second with 28 \% of the ma\ss. The catfish was probably over
represented in the diet considering that they are caught in catfish-dumps created by profe\ssional fishermen at Grand-Lieu lake, in order to reduce the density of this undesirable species. Inversely, small species
such as Gasterosteus aculeatus were not found in the diet whereas they are very numerous in the marsh.
On average herons of Grand-Lieu colony catch 1.92 kg of fish per ha of marsh (6\% of the fish standing
crops in the marsh) during the breeding season, the main predation period.},

However, invasion mechanisms of river systems are poorly documented. This theory is based upon the identification of four distinct movement behaviors: „founders“ that colonize rivers until they settle in the first available suitable habitat they encounter; „pioneers“ that migrate upstream to the upper boundaries of the system; „home range dwellers“ that establish in a given area for several months to several years; and „nomads;“ which are erratic eels that perform a general upstream shift as they search for suitable areas to forage or to settle. These behaviors are not mutually exclusive, any eel shifting from one behavior to another, depending upon ontogenetic attributes (age, experience, morphology, physiological stage, etc.), population parameters that determine density-dependent movements; and environmental parameters such as food availability, temperature, flow, and the carrying capacity of the ecosystem.},

The estuarine hydrology leads to a natural trapping of migrants in a typical area where the current speed slows down. The location of this zone depends on hydraulic conditions. The greater the tide is the farther upstream this area will be. This phenomenon leads to an increasing catchability of elvers. (2) From April onwards, when the water temperature reaches 10-- (dash)12 \textdegreeC, the gla\ss eels swim actively upstream in the estuary. Then, fish concentrate just below the first dam.

South Platte River streamflow fluctuates over 2 orders of magnitude on several time scales-monthly, annually, and over multiple year wet-dry cycles. Relatively homogeneous sampling of a single host species with several parasite species provided a system that allowed a\sse\ssment of the contribution of evolved parasite life cycles to population structure in an everchanging environment. No significant negative species-to-species a\ssociations were observed. Species abundance, order of abundance, and diversity were affected most strongly by streamflow, with high water reducing prevalence and abundance of larval trematode parasites. Each parasite species had its characteristic long- and short-term patterns of variation in population descriptor values, with mostly long-term stability superimposed on sometimes extreme short-term fluctuations of descriptor values. The differences in these characteristic patterns were considered products primarily of the evolved life cycle traits and transmi\ssion mechanisms operating in the common fluctuating environment.

	abstract = {Freshwater reclaimed marshes along the European Atlantic coast are highly suitable for European eels (Anguilla anguilla). However, European eel stocks have declined, and the coastal marshes have been subjected to major disturbances. The objective
of our study was to analyze the proce\sses governing patterns of European eel microhabitat distribution of four eel size cla\sses
(from {\textle\ss}160 mm to {\textgreater}360 mm) in a reclaimed marsh (France). Analyses were conducted using artificial neural network (ANN) techniques
and ecological profiles. Our ANN results showed that eel densities were significantly related to three major influencing variables:
the width of ditch section, the silt depth, and the density of emergent plants. Such ecological profiles were significantly
different between small ({\textle\ss}240 mm) and large eels ({\textgreater}360 mm): small eels were more widespread than large eels. Large eels were
absent or at low densities in shallow ditches with a high aquatic plant cover obstructing the water column and a large quantity
of silt. These characteristics seem to define the ditches not directly connected with the main river where dredging operations
were rare. Management of regular dredging operations in the channels by maintaining a mosaic of permanent aquatic habitats
and avoiding the heavy silt loads in most ditches should be promoted. This dredging operation was probably one of the most
promising ways for restoring inland eel stocks.},

The highly vagile European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) has suffered a dramatic decline in recruitment since two decades, urging for a better understanding of the genetic impact of pollution. Its catadromous life history constitutes a model to a\sse\ss local selection of pollutants on condition and genetic variability, as juveniles recruit in European rivers without appreciable pollution load or interfering genetic background. Because of its high fat content and local benthic feeding behaviour, the feeding stage is considered extremely prone to the bioaccumulation of pollutants. We studied the relationship between heavy metal bioaccumulation, fitne\ss (condition) and genetic variability in the European eel. The muscle ti\ssues of 78 sub-adult eels, originating from three Belgian river basins (Scheldt, Meuse and Yser), were examined for nine heavy metal pollutants (Hg, Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr, As and Se), while in total 123 individuals were genotyped at 12 allozyme and 8 microsatellite loci. A significant negative correlation between heavy metal pollution load and condition was observed, suggesting an impact of pollution on the health of sub-adult eels. In general, we observed a reduced genetic variability in strongly polluted eels, as well as a negative correlation between level of bioaccumulation and allozymatic multi-locus heterozygosity (MLH). Microsatellite genetic variability did not show any pollution related differences, suggesting a differential response at metabolic enzymes and po\ssibly direct overdominance of heterozygous individuals.},

Electrocardiograms were recorded with electrodes placed close to the fish body inside a PVC pipe shelter. After 10-40 conditioning runs, all the eels exhibited a significant conditioned response (i.e. slowing of the heart beat) to a 192,473 nT magnetic field and even to a 12,663 nT magnetic field, respectively equivalent to 5.92x and 0.38x the horizontal geomagnetic field (32,524 nT) at our laboratory. The west-east vector of the imposed magnetic field (12,663 nT) combined with that of the geomagnetic field and produced a horizontal resultant magnetic field of 21 degrees easterly. Therefore, Japanese eel are magnetosensitive whether they are at sea, in the river or in the farm.

Female age was not related to latitude (r = 0.57, p = 0.27) but male age showed a positive relationship (r = 0.87, p = 0.05). Growth rates for females and males were inversely related to latitude (r = -0.98, p = 0.02 and r = -0.95, p = 0.05, respectively).

The European eel Anguilla anguilla (Linnaeus, 1758) stock is declining rapidly due to overfishing, pollution, habitat degradation, diseases, and oceanic conditions. We analyzed arrival waves of gla\ss eels collected in the Bay of Biscay and the western Mediterranean area during the period 2001-2003. We observed significant differences in length, weight, and condition between Atlantic and Mediterranean samples, and among arrival waves within sites. All samples were screened for genetic variation using ten allozyme and six microsatellite loci. We observed a pattern of genetic patchine\ss among arrival waves, namely a highly significant genetic differentiation without a temporal grouping of samples. Although natural selection and gene flow could also play a role, we suggest that the pattern observed results from the high variance in reproductive succe\ss in each spawning season. A low effective population size might have contributed to the current decline in the abundance of European eel. A precautionary approach to fisheries should be implemented in order to preserve maximal genetic potential to cope with changing anthropogenic and environment pre\ssures.},

	abstract = {Because of their unusual life cycle, American and European eels (Anguilla rostrata Lesueur and A. anguilla L.), are particularly exposed to pollutant effects. Because silver eels fast when they leave the freshwater system, the transoceanic migration forces them to constitute energy reserves in the form of muscle lipids, that are needed for succe\ssful spawning. Using species biological data, toxicological and ecotoxicological information, hypotheses are given to a\sse\ss the contribution of pollution from freshwater sources to the recorded decline in the American and European eels fisheries since the 1980s. This paper first describes the lipid storage problems and the relative migratory capacities. Then several studies on the accumulation of xenobiotics in various anatomical compartments, on the biological half-lives of these compounds, and on their sublethal toxicity, are reviewed. During migration, lipid mobilization returns persistent lipophilic pollutants back into circulation, these being concentrated particularly in gonads at the crucial time of gametogenesis. Extrapolation of toxicological analysis (individual physiology) to the population level (spawning succe\ss) suggests that the quality of future spawners leaving freshwaters is one of the prime factors for the conservation of this threatened species.},

	abstract = {The problem of the propagation and breeding places of the Common or Fresh-water Eel is one of great antiquity; from the days of Aristotle naturalists have occupied themselves therewith, and in certain regions of Europe it has exercised popular imagination to a remarkable degree. It is only during the last three decades, however, that any real results have been attained. It has long been known that the full-grown eels move down in the autumn from their rivers and lakes to the sea; the most important eel fisheries, indeed, are based upon this seaward migration. The eels do not return again from the sea, but in early spring there appear on the coasts myriads of small young eels, eagerly seeking their way up to fresh-water. These eel fry are known in most countries of Europe, and occur in some parts in such quantities as to form the object of a particular industry; for instance, in the River Severn in England, where they are known as “elvers.” Until 1896, the elver stage was the earliest stage of development in which the eel was known on the shores of Europe, and it was generally supposed that the elvers arriving in the spring were the offspring of the eels which had migrated during the previous autumn. They are not, however, altogether minute, like the newly-hatched larva of a cod or herring; on the contrary, they are no le\ss than 6-7 cm. in length.},

	abstract = {An understanding of the ecological functioning of an aquatic continuum on a multi-regional scale relies on the ability to collect suitable descriptive information. Here, the deterministic Seneque/Riverstrahler model, linking biogeochemistry with the constraints set by geomorphology and anthropogenic activities, was fully implemented to study the Seine, Somme, and Scheldt Rivers. Reasonable agreement was found between calculated and observed nutrient fluxes for both seasonal and inter-annual variations along the networks. Nutrient budgets underline: i) a clear partition of diffuse and point sources with respect to the specific activities of the watersheds, ii) the importance of riparian retention, responsible for 25-- (dash)50\% of nitrogen retention, iii) the role played by benthic proce\sses, resulting in the retention of up to 45\% of the phosphorus and 35\% of the silica entering the river systems. Nutrient ratios confirmed that fluxes to the Eastern Southern Bight of the North Sea are imbalanced, supporting the potential for undesirable algal blooms.},

However, invasion mechanisms of river systems are poorly documented. This theory is based upon the identification of four distinct movement behaviors: „founders“ that colonize rivers until they settle in the first available suitable habitat they encounter; „pioneers“ that migrate upstream to the upper boundaries of the system; „home range dwellers“ that establish in a given area for several months to several years; and „nomads;“ which are erratic eels that perform a general upstream shift as they search for suitable areas to forage or to settle. These behaviors are not mutually exclusive, any eel shifting from one behavior to another, depending upon ontogenetic attributes (age, experience, morphology, physiological stage, etc.), population parameters that determine density-dependent movements; and environmental parameters such as food availability, temperature, flow, and the carrying capacity of the ecosystem.},

	abstract = {The migration pattern of silver eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) in the Baltic is well documented from many tagging experiments. This particular investigation differed from previous taggings in that the background of all the eels used was the same. They came from a 1980 stocking programme and had been imported from France as gla\ss eels. When migrating these stocked eels mi\ssed the outlet of the Baltic and continued in a south-westerly direction. They were still reported in this southern-most area more than 4 yr later. Indigenous eels turn northwards after pa\ssing the south of Sweden and leave the Baltic through the narrow Sound. Since the formerly stocked eels had never been in the Baltic, the absence of an imprinted olfaction cue may explain their orientation failure. Although lacking an imprinted olfaction cue eels were recaptured mainly in a very restricted area in the southwestern Baltic. This reflects another cue, genetic or imprinted during the Atlantic journey. This second cue, temperate, can also serve as the trigger which causes eels to stop migrating and to initiate spawning. The enclosed Baltic acts as a giant trap for eels from the huge stocking programmes undertaken there. As a consequence stocked eels probably contribute little to spawning stocks in the Sarga\sso Sea which may have contributed to the decrease in abundance of gla\ss eels reported from western Europe in recent decades.},

	abstract = {Studies were conducted during 1991-1993 on environmental factors affecting the upstream migration of eels in the Rivers Severn and Avon, England. Migrants ({\textgreater} 156 000 pigmented elvers and {\textgreater} 189 000 juveniles) were trapped as they attempted to ascend weir or sluice barriers. Multiple regre\ssion models were developed to compare catches per trap per night (C) with data for various key environmental parameters at seven sites, from the tidal limit to a maximum of 42.5 km upstream. The key stimulus for migration of both elvers and juveniles at the tidal limit was water temperature, with some weaker monthly influences related to seasonal temperature increases. Smaller annual influences probably related to earlier gla\ss eel recruitment into the lower estuary. A weak early tidal effect was demonstrated only once, in 1993 in the Severn. Temperature also exerted significant effects on C of juvenile eels at the tidal limit and in the non-tidal rivers, although effects weakened with distance upstream. Year, month, river flows and whether traps were mounted on weirs or sluices made only small contributions at a few sites. Distance between traps also contributed to combined data for upper Severn sites. The threshold temperature in all cases was 14-16\textdegreeC, with low to zero catches below 10-11\textdegreeC, catch maxima being achieved above 18-20\textdegreeC. The implications of strong temperature-dependence of migration in relation to stock recruitment and management are discu\ssed. Special reference is made to recent decreases in recruitment of eels to Europe and N. America and po\ssible long-term effects of global warming.},
